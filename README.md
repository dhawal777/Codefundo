                                 IMPROVING FAULT TOLERENCE METHOD IN PREDICTION OF DISASTER MANAGEMENT
Their is lot of reasearch that is going on on preventing disaster management but it has been observed that it is a infinite while loop running
of developing a disaster management system and it fail at some point of time and the worls is affected by damage that caused by that disaster. so i would like to develop a system that is could manage faults that occur in prediction of disaster management by carefully observing  all data that is used by current disaster predictors currently running(particularly GDACS which currently working on it) and the points where it fail and then further applying convolution network algorithms on particularly the fauts points of prediction that could seggregate the common fault that occur in such times when this system have failed in predicting in getting on the best result of it.

Apart from convoution neural network algorithm and there would be need of some system that could alert if some common thing detected that could
even reduce observer efforts so the whole system will be linked through IOT and alert on output will be only made if extent of fault domination in failure are beyond some precision value which will be calculated by regression techniques of ML in the process when neural network will process faulty data.so i propose my idea for developing a system on identifying faulty points of currently running disaster predicting systems and improvising all of them in once by identifying some common and generic bug with the help of ML,Convolution neural Network and IOT for Alert.
